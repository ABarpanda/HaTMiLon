Introducing a platform akin to KYC (Know Your College) tailored specifically for colleges like ours, NIT Rourkela.

Navigating through our expansive campus, especially as a fresher, can be a daunting task. From deciphering the intricate layout to locating essential facilities like hostels, tech points, or even the nearest tea shop, the plethora of information can overwhelm anyone. While orientation sessions aim to cover these aspects, the sheer volume of details can be hard to digest.

Hence, we propose the creation of a dedicated website designed to streamline the college experience for newcomers. This platform will serve as a comprehensive guide, offering insights into various aspects of campus life. Unlike conventional maps or generic navigation tools like Google Maps, which often lack specific details or accuracy, our website will provide tailored information relevant to NIT Rourkela.

Key features of our platform include:

Customized Campus Map[link](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon): Our interactive map will not only outline the campus layout but also highlight key locations such as academic buildings, hostels, dining halls, tech support centers, recreational areas, and more.

Points of Interest[link](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon/essentials.html): Beyond basic navigation, users can easily locate specific points of interest, whether it's the designated tech support hub or the chai spot Arun's Tea Shop. Detailed descriptions and reviews will accompany each point of interest, ensuring users find what they need efficiently.

User-Generated Content: Students, faculty, and staff can contribute to the platform by sharing their insights, tips, and recommendations. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of community and enriches the overall user experience.

Events and Activities[link](file:///C:/Users/abarp/Desktop/Hackathon/HaTMiLon/news.html): Stay updated on upcoming events, club meetings, workshops, and other campus activities through our event calendar. Users can subscribe to personalized notifications based on their interests and preferences.

Feedback Mechanism[link](file:///C:/Users/abarp/Desktop/Hackathon/HaTMiLon/suggestions.html): Continuous improvement is paramount. Users can provide feedback, report issues, or suggest enhancements to ensure the platform remains relevant and user-friendly.

By bridging the gap between information and accessibility, our website aims to alleviate the challenges faced by newcomers and enhance the overall campus experience at NIT Rourkela.

Let's explore college life with confidence and clarity, together!
