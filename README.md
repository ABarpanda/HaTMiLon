Hey everyone! We are a small group of freshers from NIT Rourkela.

Ever felt lost in our huge campus? Yeah, been there! From finding our hostels to grabbing a quick chai at Arun's between the classes, it's like working through a maze.

What have we done? To guide every fresher and outsider, through our very own college, we have created a website. By freshers, for freshers. We like to call it "Know Your College (KYC)"

What does the website contain? Here's a detailed summary-

Don't know where you are? Where to go? How to go? The very personalised [map of only NIT Rourkela](abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon) is at your service.

Mess food is not good? Wanna have a party with friends? The [Food](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon/food.html) webpage shows you where to go. And yes, it shows the direction to that place too.

Not a person who reads news regularly? Don't worry, the [News](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon/news.html) is served up to you in a very aesthetic manner.

Don't know where to attend your classes? Orientation is held in BBA, but WHERE IS BBA? For that we have our [Academic_Area](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon/academic_area.html) page

You also like to keep yourself healthy? Come and play any sport of your choice. Where? [Here](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon/sports.html)

Got settled? Very nice. But you need a haircut once in a while? Or maybe your cycle got a flat tire. The [Essentials](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon/essentials.html) page is here to help

Found some bug in the website? Something wrong from our side? Go to the [Suggestions](https://abarpanda.github.io/HaTMiLon/suggestions.html) page and write to us. (Please avoid spamming)

If you are a senior, who likes help juniors so that they don't go through the same trouble as you; I am delighted to inform you that the whole project is Open-Source. Yes you read it right. You can also contribute. You can also make new features that can be added for the collective benefit of everyone.
