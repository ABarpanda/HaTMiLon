          design products include items such as mobile phones, automobiles,
          household appliances, electronic equipment, furniture, jewelry etc.
          and products which will be made as one-offs, such as craft products,
          trophies, or models and full-scale mock-ups. The industrial designers
          also use their skills to invent completely new products, to do
          computer modelling and animation, and to propose new ways of doing
          everyday things. In addition to aesthetic concerns, social references,
